                        with a focus on rural communities. It involves a Train-the-Trainer Plan to train youths and adults
                        as community organizers to provide coaching programs that improve literacy levels of primary school
                        pupils. The aim is to empower youth and adults to become agents of social change in their
                        communities by ensuring children can read and write before the age of 10. The program plans to
                        extend to pastoral families and explore alternative modes of teaching via local and cheap
                        communication means, partnering with media platforms such as the BBC to reach the target audience.

                    The education sector in Nigeria has faced challenges due to factors such as population growth, low
                    government budget allocation, and limited resources. However, technology is driving change in teaching
                    and learning paradigms, with e-learning providing affordable access to educational content. The
                    e-learning market in Africa is projected to be worth over $530 million by 2018. An upcoming Summit will
                    focus on e-learning tools, resources, services, and best practices, and will offer opportunities for
                    collaboration on the use of technology in education.
