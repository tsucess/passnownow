                <p class="text-dark">
                    Passnownow.com is a mobile learning platform that has digitized Nigeria's school curriculum content from
                    JSS1 to SS3. It allows students to read ahead of classes and provides past questions and answers for
                    university entrance exams. The platform also shares grammar tips and includes a leaderboard that
                    measures users' studying efforts. Passnownow.com's disruptive innovation strategy has been analyzed by
                    Harvard Business School researchers for a book on innovation, prosperity, and poverty. The platform aims
                    to democratize access to quality curriculum-based education content for underserved students, teachers,
                    and communities across Nigeria.The aim of the online education platform swagric.com is to increase
                    enrollment and improve academic performance of students while empowering teachers through online class
                    notes, practice questions, and past exams. The platform also provides a chat room for users to share
                    knowledge and solve common problems. The platform is accessible for a low fee of N300 and has been well
                    received by both teachers and parents, who are using it to supplement classroom learning due to a
                    shortage of quality textbooks and a lack of financial resources.
