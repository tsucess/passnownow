                        Passnownow wants parents to be as much a part of the learning experience of their wards just like
                        their teachers. Your influence and inputs are valuable and we want to be able to give you as much
                        information as possible to help you understand the goals of PNN.
                        <br><br>
                        PNN is a wholesome support platform for young people moving from teenage
                        to early adulthood, predominantly in secondary schools or preparing
                        for O-level final examinations. The academic materials on the site
                        are designed based on the approved Nigerian Secondary School Education curriculum.
                        <br><br>
                        Passnownow.com offers a range of benefits to parents, considering the
                        fact that it is a cost-effective medium to improve your child’s performance
                        without the extra cost of hiring a lesson teacher.
                        <br><br>
                        Parents can use the site’s resources to monitor their children’s academic
                        progress as it has the same content as the curriculum used in secondary schools.
                        <br><br>
                        It is also a safer medium as there are no risks of leaving your children and wards with strangers in
                        the guise of extra mural classes.
